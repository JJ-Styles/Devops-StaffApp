# StaffApp
StaffApp for Devops.
This piece of software was made for an ICA for a University module. It demonstrates Devops practices within an Asp.net web app. This app should connect to other apps and api's so is setup to have fakes in place to allow for the app to work without. This app was deployed to Microsoft Azure but has been taken down as the trail for Azure expired.
